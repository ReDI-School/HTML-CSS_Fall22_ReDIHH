# HTML Tags 1

## Class Agenda

The class must not have a strict separation of theory and exercise. Instead the whole class must be one big exercise with theory in between.

At the end of the class students would need to have written their own HTML document which follows the example given in the [HTML Checkpoint4 file](./Checkpoint4.html).

1. Headings
2. HTML paragraphs
3. HTML text styling tags
4. HTML Header and Footer
5. Maintainable HTML

# 1. Headings

- What are the headings tags?
- When do we use each heading and what are the differences between them?

ETA: 20min

# 2. HTML paragraphs

Following the [HTML Paragraphs Tutorial on w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_paragraphs.asp) we need to learn about:

- What HTML `<p>` tag is?

# 3. HTML text styling tags

This section covers basic HTML tags used for styling text. These tags include. Students should practice with a couple of these tags.

# Glossary & Terminology

- `Code Maintainability` - This is a characteristic of the code and specifies the level of ease with which a developer can make changes to the code in future. If your code has bad maintainability then it would be very difficult for you or other people to change parts of the code in future. Code with bad maintainability often leads to hidden bugs.
- `Code Readability` - This is a characteristic of the code and specifies the level of ease with which a developer can read the code. If your code has bad readability then it would be very difficult for you and other people to understand what your code is doing.
- `Empty tag` - An empty html tag is a tag which has no closing tag and no content. It simply stands on its own. Examples include, `<br>`, `<hr>`, `<meta>`
