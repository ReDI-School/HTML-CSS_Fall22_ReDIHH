# Ideas

Here are some general improvement ideas that we could introduce for our HTML & CSS course. We might need more time to tackle these so maybe we should do this in between semesters.

## Idea 1

Using Github Classrooms as a way to manage student's assignments, homework, exercises, etc. (Tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXWXg68KpTY)

## Idea 2

Measuring somehow students motivation in the first classes

## Idea 3

Assigning experienced teachers for the first few classes so that we spark the motivation and joy in students.

## Idea 4

It seems that some students have problems when working with VS Code. We might need to have a small section in the beginning of our course about how to use VS Code. In other words -> Intro to VS Code. This should include among others the following points:

- How to create a new file/ folder
- What are the side icons on the left side panel
- How to start the live development server
- How to save / edit file (when is a file not saved and when is it saved)
- etc.

## Idea 5

I recommend that we use an Online Code Editor like [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) in class for students to write code. 
It is easier for the teacher to see their progress in real time that way compared to screen sharing. (Seun)
