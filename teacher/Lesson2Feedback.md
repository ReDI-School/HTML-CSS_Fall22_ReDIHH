# Teacher Feedback of Session 2

- I had problems to present the Project CV Pitch on time. It felt like I had to rush through this part
- The Project CV Pitch also felt a little bit out of place.
- My suggestion is to move this CV Pitch to the first session because the first session is relatively empty and it would also be good to spark the motivation in students from the very beginning!
