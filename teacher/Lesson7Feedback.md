# Teacher Feedback of Lesson 7

## What went well:

- I got good participation from the students using Slido Quizes and Polls that I prepared before the class. This took extra teacher preparation time, but it was worth it.
- I introduced the students to an Online Code Editor (CodeSandBox). When they write code in this tool, they are able to share a URL with me and I can monitor their progress and give feedback to them. Below are some examples of the class exercises:
  - [Bashir](https://codesandbox.io/s/bashir-b6u0s?file=/index.html:745-757)
  - [Glory](https://codesandbox.io/s/glory-class7-7m9mt?file=/index.html)
  - [Salma](https://codesandbox.io/s/salma-class7-itkgp?file=/index.html:385-403)
  - [William](https://codesandbox.io/s/william-bx1sl?file=/index.html:982-1099)
  - [Obinna](https://codesandbox.io/s/obinna-class-7-68t5w?file=/index.html)

## What can be improved:

- Because I took time to explain Checkpoints and CodeSandbox to the students, I was unable to cover every topic planned for the class. If we agree to have these things as part of the course, we should introduce them at the beginning.
- While it is good to monitor that students correctly write the code taught in the class using CodeSandbox, it takes time. During my class, I tried to check the work of many students (close to 10), but it's not sustainable. I don't have a suggestion for fixing this. Ideas are welcomed.
